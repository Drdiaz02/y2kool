# 🎮 Y2Kool — A Digital Time Capsule of Early-2000s Gaming Culture

Y2Kool is a web apps project built to capture the spirit, sound, and style of the early 2000s — a defining era in gaming and internet culture. From the GameCube, PS2, and original Xbox, to the wild world of AIM, MySpace, and Habbo Hotel, this site serves as both a nostalgic tribute and an educational look at the evolution of digital life.

The intent of this website is to:

Celebrate the creativity and innovation of Y2K-era gaming and technology.

Explore how early 2000s design, culture, and community shaped today’s gaming world.

Attempt to recreate the look and feel of the web in that time — loud colors, chunky buttons, and the thrill of discovery before social media took over.

Y2Kool isn’t just about remembering old consoles — it’s about remembering how it felt to grow up when the future still glowed in cathode rays and 16-bit startup sounds.

# Develepor Notes

- Day 1
    As I build out the site things are coming back to me that I remember about the times. Like the culture; baggy jeans and studded belts, frosted tips and flip phones, pop-punk playlists and Myspace, pixel hearts, glitter text, alt cursors and absolute chaos!
