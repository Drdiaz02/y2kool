# 🎮 Y2Kool — A Digital Time Capsule of Early-2000s Gaming Culture

Y2Kool is a web apps project built to capture the spirit, sound, and style of the early 2000s — a defining era in gaming and internet culture. From the GameCube, PS2, and original Xbox, to the wild world of AIM, MySpace, and Habbo Hotel, this site serves as both a nostalgic tribute and an educational look at the evolution of digital life.

The intent of this website is to:

Celebrate the creativity and innovation of Y2K-era gaming and technology.

Explore how early 2000s design, culture, and community shaped today’s gaming world.

Attempt to recreate the look and feel of the web in that time — loud colors, chunky buttons, and the thrill of discovery before social media took over.

Y2Kool isn’t just about remembering old consoles — it’s about remembering how it felt to grow up when the future still glowed in cathode rays and 16-bit startup sounds.

# Develepor Notes

- Day 1
    As I build out the site things are coming back to me that I remember about the times. Like the culture; baggy jeans and studded belts, frosted tips and flip phones, pop-punk playlists and Myspace, pixel hearts, glitter text, alt cursors and absolute chaos!

- Day 2-5
    I built some quick place holders for some of my pages and became blinded by the ambition of making my webpage come to life. There are so many ideas I have swimming in my head that I want to be able to make possible, but the problem with coding is that you must always focus on a single problem and sove it. So for the past few sessions beyond building simple placeholders and implementing an awesome styling choice for the page, I have been attempting to make an overlay that presents itself to the user on the initial visit to the site (the loading of a site) that will be specific to each page! The home page is a welcome overlay, and each console page will have its respective boot sequence to welcome the user. This will be the next goal I tackle as I move forward since I feel filling the page up and styling is much easier than defining specific behavior.
    - Today in class we went over some cool topics for javascript, functions! Functions are familiar but we went over some pretty interesting ways of manipulating functions to work for us. I went from trying to set an overlay as a static object that would disappear on its own, which did not go over well. However, working with 'events' really helped me understand how I can manipulate the page to perform certain actions during certain moments.
    - The style sheet took a while to make while exploring different options. I have more I want to do with it but I am also trying to take it slow to make sure everything works and looks correct so that I can focus on scaling instead of debugging. The gamecube page has a logo of the gamecube on the back which I will do for the other console pages. I was able to fix a small issue where the picture didnt cover the entire page and left a bar of white at the bottom with a simple background color = black to cover the rest of the page.

- Day ~6-9
    I have broken out some logic in a test file to try and get some more behavior that I can use on my page. The documentation can be found on "matrix.html" I will move that documentation here after I get it working on the main page.
        I was finally able to merge the behavior of the matrix terminal intro and the fade in event. I found a css rule that will help me with the fade in instead of using javascript to handle it for me. Where I had some javascript trying to handle it (which took a few functions and some timing) css was able to handle with a single block of code and a few lines @keyframes made my life way easier with this task.

    I am working on trying to get the page to behave correctly again. It does some key things like terminal typing and fading but its not dialed in yet.
